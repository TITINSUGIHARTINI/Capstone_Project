## MatchSense - Machine Learning Repository
## Overview
MatchSense is a machine learning project that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to compare text similarity. Designed to aid in academic and professional writing, this repository contains the machine learning implementation that powers the application's core feature: calculating a similarity score between two text inputs.

## Features
- Text Similarity Calculation: Bilateral LSTM-based model to compute similarity scores.
- Pretrained English Language Dataset: Optimized for English due to limited Indonesian datasets.
- Model Serialization: Saved in .h5 and .json formats for easy deployment and integration.
